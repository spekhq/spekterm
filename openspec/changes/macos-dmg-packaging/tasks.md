## 1. Measurements on the Mac (before the code they decide — design A2)

- [ ] 1.1 With the maintainer, grant the one-time macOS permissions the acceptance needs: Accessibility,
  and Automation for System Events, for the program the SSH session runs. Verify: `osascript` reading
  Finder's menu bar items returns names instead of timing out with `-1712`.
- [ ] 1.2 Copy the working tree to the Mac's clone (`rsync`, design Migration Plan). Build an unsigned
  trial bundle there: `npm run build && node scripts/package-mac.mjs -- --dir -c.mac.identity=null`. Measure with
  a temporary, uncommitted instrumentation in `src/main/index.ts`: an Edit menu of roles, and a log line
  per `close` / `before-quit`. Record each result under this task:
  - whether `Cmd+V` in the terminal pastes twice;
  - whether macOS adds its own items (Start Dictation, Emoji & Symbols) to a menu named Edit;
  - whether a role item's `label` override shows on macOS;
  - the event order of `osascript -e 'tell application id "com.spekterm.app" to quit'`;
  - the event order of `kill -TERM`.

  Remove the instrumentation afterwards. **If the quit Apple event emits `close` first, stop and ask the
  maintainer before section 3.** Logout and shutdown would then be held by the sessions dialog, which is a
  requirement-level trade-off, not a scenario edit.
  - 2026-10-08, measured remotely: an instrumented, unsigned trial bundle, launched with `open` and its own
    throwaway profile, built in a scratch copy on the Mac and not in the repo. `kill -TERM` gives
    `before-quit` → `close` → `closed`, and the app exits by itself, the same order as on Linux.
  - The rest needs someone at the Mac, and waits for 1.1: the paste, the Edit-menu items, the label
    override, and the quit Apple event (the Automation prompt has to be answered on its screen).
- [x] 1.3 On the Mac, with a throwaway script run by `electron` that prints `app.getPath('userData')` with
  and without `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`: confirm that the variable is ignored on macOS. This avoids `npm run dev`,
  which would write into the real data directory. Record under this task.
  - 2026-10-08, Electron 43.5.0 on macOS 13.7.8, with a script whose package declares `productName:
    Spekterm`: without the variable and with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/spk/xdg`, both print
    `~/Library/Application Support/Spekterm`. The variable is ignored, as the spec gap says.

## 2. Packaging configuration and release scripts

- [x] 2.1 `package.json`:
  - add `build.mac` (dmg, `arm64`, `identity: "-"`, `hardenedRuntime: false`, category, icon,
    `extraResources` for the two licence files) and `build.dmg`;
  - move the top-level `extraFiles` into `build.linux.extraFiles`;
  - add `build.afterPack`, the `dist:mac` script (release check → `npm ci` → build → `package-mac` →
    prune), and `@electron/get` as a devDependency pinned to the version installed under `electron`.

  Verify: `npm ci` succeeds. `npm ls @electron/get --all` shows `electron`'s copy as `deduped` against the
  root's 5.x; `app-builder-lib`'s 3.x copy stays separate, as expected.
- [x] 2.2 `scripts/release-check.mjs`. It takes the repo root from `argv`, and the platform from an argument
  or option so that tests can run it as macOS. It uses `LC_ALL=C`, and imports `VERSION_FILES` from
  `release-bump.mjs`. It refuses:
  - a platform other than macOS;
  - a dirty tree, untracked files included;
  - a subject that is not `chore(release): <declared version>`;
  - a release commit that changes files other than the version files;
  - a clone shallower than two commits.

  Each refusal states the fix. Verify with `scripts/release-check.test.mjs` on git fixtures, run as macOS:
  - **refused, each by its reason's text, not just the exit code**: a later commit, an untracked file, a
    wrong-version subject, an extra file in the release commit, a shallow clone;
  - **passes**: a detached release commit;
  - **refused as the real CLI on Linux**, with a message naming macOS.
- [x] 2.3 `scripts/package-mac.mjs`: the real `@electron/get` `downloadArtifact`, with `checksums` from
  `node_modules/electron/checksums.json` and the mirror via `ELECTRON_MIRROR`, then
  `electron-builder --mac -c.electronDist=<zip>`. Verify with `scripts/package-mac.test.mjs`, calling the
  real `downloadArtifact` with an injected `downloader` and a temporary `cacheRoot`:
  - a fixture zip whose hash is in the map passes;
  - an altered map entry throws;
  - the map is read for the installed `electron` version.
- [x] 2.4 `scripts/after-pack.cjs`, macOS only:
  - delete `Contents/Resources/default_app.asar` (tolerating its absence);
  - copy the Electron distribution's `LICENSE` to `Contents/Resources/LICENSE.electron.txt`, and its
    `LICENSES.chromium.html`.

  On Linux it does nothing. Verify with `scripts/after-pack.test.mjs` on fixture output directories for
  both platforms.
- [x] 2.5 `scripts/prune-release.mjs`: AppImages and dmgs are counted separately, two of each kept by
  version order, and a dmg's `.blockmap` goes with it. Verify with `scripts/prune-release.test.mjs`: three
  of each kind, dmg names across a ten boundary (`0.1.9` / `0.1.10`), and an unrelated file kept.
- [x] 2.6 `scripts/packaging-config.test.mjs`, with a control for each new check (remove or alter the item,
  see red):
  - the macOS target fields;
  - no top-level `extraFiles` and no `build.mac.extraFiles`;
  - `dist:mac` ordering: release check before the build, `package-mac` and no direct `electron-builder`
    call, prune last, and no `release-bump`;
  - `artifactName`, if set under `build.mac` or `build.dmg`, contains the version;
  - `@electron/get`'s declared version equals the copy that `electron` resolves (resolved from
    `node_modules/electron`, not the hoisted copy).
- [x] 2.7 `scripts/site-boundary.test.mjs` reads every `build.{linux,mac,win}.{files,extraFiles,extraResources}`.
  Verify its new control: a `site/**` entry in `build.mac.extraResources` makes it red.
- [x] 2.8 `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` green.
  - 1803 unit tests pass. Lint needed a block for `scripts/**/*.cjs` (CommonJS, Node globals): the
    `afterPack` hook is the first CommonJS script.
  - Controls run by hand, each red, then restored:
    - `release-check`: the changed-files check removed, and the dirty-tree check removed;
    - `package-mac`: `unsafelyDisableChecksums` passed instead of `checksums`.
  - `VERSION_FILES` and the release subject moved to `scripts/lib/release-files.mjs`, which `release-bump`
    and `release-check` share.

## 3. Window, menu, and quit (main process and renderer)

- [x] 3.1 The menu (design W1):
  - a template builder in a module that does not import `electron`: macOS gets the minimal template, with
    labels from the dictionaries, a custom Quit item with `Cmd+Q`, and no Window menu or `Cmd+W`;
    Linux and Windows get `null`;
  - `src/main/index.ts` sets the menu once in `whenReady`, not in `createWindow`;
  - `src/main/ipc/settings.ts`'s `setLanguage` rebuilds it;
  - `en.json` / `zh-TW.json` gain the labels.

  Verify:
  - a unit test of the builder for both platforms and both languages;
  - `probe:shell`'s Alt check green;
  - `dictionary-completeness`, `i18n-key-safety`, and `copy-language` green.
  - `src/main/app-menu.ts` (no Electron import) and `app-menu.test.ts`: Linux and Windows `null`; macOS two
    menus with exactly the listed roles, Quit a custom `Command+Q` item, nothing on `+W`, and labels from
    the dictionaries in the current language (checked in `zh-TW`).
  - The menu is set in `whenReady` and rebuilt on i18next's `languageChanged`. That covers the startup
    language and the Settings change from one place, so `ipc/settings.ts` needs no callback.
  - **Correction**: the task's verification says "`probe:shell`'s Alt check green". `probe:shell` has no
    Alt check; it passed 29/29, but none of its checks presses Alt. The Linux "no menu" scenario is carried
    by the unit test of the template only, and the coverage table says so.
- [x] 3.2 `src/main/close-guard.ts` (design W2):
  - each close decision carries an intent (`close` / `quit`);
  - `before-quit` first, or the Quit item, sets `quit`;
  - a quit request during an open dialog upgrades the intent;
  - cancel discards it;
  - `onClosed('quit')` calls `app.quit()`.

  Verify with unit tests for each path: nothing to ask, asked and confirmed, unsaved changes answered on an
  OS quit, a quit during the open dialog then close, and a quit during the open dialog then cancel followed
  by a confirmed plain close, which does not quit. The existing close-guard and quit tests stay green.
  - `GuardedWindow.closeForQuit()` and `CloseGuardDeps.onQuitClose`. `index.ts` finishes the quit with
    `app.quit()` on the window's `closed`.
  - Seven new cases in `close-guard.test.ts`. Controls, each red, then restored: without the upgrade
    during an open prompt, and without `onQuitClose` on the nothing-to-ask path.
  - The guard also tells the prompt whether the close ends the application. This is W4's second line,
    and on macOS it changes the buttons too: Close Window, Save All and Close, Close Without Saving.
- [x] 3.3 Window lifecycle (design W3), its logic in modules that do not import `electron`:
  - `ensureWindow()` replaces `bringToFront()` at the notification click, open inbox, and reveal-brief
    sites;
  - a per-window cleanup that `destroyed` runs, including `disposeConversationFor`;
  - a new `app:rendererReady` IPC in the preload allow-list, sent by the renderer once its intake and
    handoff listeners are mounted.

  Verify:
  - a unit test of `ensureWindow`: it creates the window and acts only after ready;
  - a unit test that the cleanup releases the conversation tracking;
  - `probe:shell`'s allow-list assertion updated and green.
  - `src/main/window-presence.ts` and its test: create when there is no window, wait for the renderer's
    ready signal, a renderer that went away must signal again, and a timeout so that a renderer that
    never signals cannot hold an action forever.
  - `index.ts`: the notification click goes through `presence.ensure()`; `activate` reopens through the
    same window dependencies.
  - `AppShell` sends `app.rendererReady()` from its own effect. A parent's effect runs after its
    children's, so the inbox, brief, and focus listeners are mounted by then.
  - `ipc/terminal.ts`: the destroyed and reload paths now share one `releaseRenderer` body, which
    includes `disposeConversationFor`. **No unit test for this one**: the module imports `electron`. The
    shared body is what makes the two paths unable to differ again.
- [x] 3.4 Audit the main-process state keyed by window or `webContents.id`: maps, watchers, broadcasters,
  `quitState`, and the close-guard state. Release anything found in the per-window cleanup. Record the
  audit list under this task.
  - Audit, 2026-10-08. Each entry is released on `destroyed` (and on `did-navigate` where it matters):
    - `ipc/folders` branchServices, `ipc/panel` pending, `ipc/openspec` services, `ipc/fs` services;
    - `ipc/terminal` services, owners, statusServices, and pending (flushed);
    - `hibernation` displayed (deleted on `null`), `dirty-state`;
    - `guardedWindows`, and presence readiness.
  - The intake and Slack sender sets prune destroyed senders. `revealHandoffBrief` sends to the live
    windows.
  - The only leak found was the conversation tracking, fixed in 3.3.
- [x] 3.5 `src/main/terminal.ts`: the `ptyCwdReadable` predicate, used by `readPtyCwd`. Dictionaries: the
  close dialog's consequence text, split by where shells restart and by what is closing (design W4).
  Verify with a unit test that the text chosen on a platform without a readable cwd says "folder", and on
  macOS "window". `dictionary-completeness` stays green.
  - `src/main/pty-cwd.ts` (`ptyCwdReadable`, `readPtyCwd`), moved out of `terminal.ts`, with tests.
  - Dictionaries: `consequenceFolder`, `consequenceWindow`, and `consequenceWindowFolder`, and the window
    button labels, in both languages. `close-prompt.test.ts` covers the folder and window wording.
- [ ] 3.6 If 1.2 measured a double paste: in `src/renderer/src/shell/terminal/xterm.ts`, the custom key
  handler calls `preventDefault()` for the keys it handles itself (`Cmd+V`, and `Cmd+C` with a selection).
  If not, record that here and leave the code.
- [x] 3.7 `src/main/user-env.ts`: correct the comment that says macOS's `env` lacks `-0`, citing the
  measurement in design Context.
- [x] 3.8 `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` green.

## 4. Acceptance

- [x] 4.1 `scripts/probe-package.mjs` (Linux): assert `LICENSE.electron.txt` and `LICENSES.chromium.html`
  at the AppImage root. Run it without bumping: `npm run build && npx electron-builder --linux`, then
  `PROBE_PACKAGE_APPIMAGE=<path> node scripts/run-probe.mjs package`. Confirm green, including the
  existing licence assertions after the move to `build.linux.extraFiles`.
  - 2026-10-08, AppImage built with `npx electron-builder --linux` from the working tree: 16/17. The new
    check ("the AppImage root carries Electron's and Chromium's licence texts") and every existing licence
    check pass after the move to `build.linux.extraFiles`.
  - The one red, "打包指令自身遞增版本並提交", is the expected cost of not bumping: HEAD is not a release
    commit. It turns green on the release run (6.1).
  - Note: this replaced `release/Spekterm-0.2.3.AppImage` with a build of the working tree. The published
    0.2.3 on GitHub is untouched.
- [ ] 4.2 `scripts/probe-package-mac.mjs`, run as `npm run probe:package:mac`, which is `node` directly,
  not `run-probe.mjs`:
  - ports in `scripts/lib/ports.mjs`; left out of `run-probes.mjs`;
  - `PROBE_PACKAGE_MAC_DMG` to point at any dmg or `.app`; the default is the declared version's dmg;
  - a pid-based `quitAndWait` in `scripts/lib/quit.mjs`; `preflight.mjs`'s port-holder lookup checked on
    macOS;
  - a pre-flight for macOS, the bundle present, the UI-scripting and Automation permissions, and an
    unlocked logged-in screen;
  - the sections of design A1 steps 1–9, with:
    - real sheets read and clicked through UI scripting;
    - `Cmd+Q` pressed with focus in the terminal and in the editor;
    - the agent section last;
    - the `LSMinimumSystemVersion` and top-of-`Contents/` checks;
    - every section that needs a permission declaring it as a dependency.

  Verify: `npm test` green (ports, globs, `quit-source`).
  - Written. Run on the Mac (2026-10-08) against a trial dmg built from the rsynced tree: 13/24.
    - Green: the static checks (seal, placeholder, licences, top of `Contents/`, `LSMinimumSystemVersion`),
      the minimal-environment control, renderer, CSP, pty + command, `claude` resolved in a session, and
      the agent session.
    - Red as expected: the build identity (a trial build reports uncommitted changes).
    - Not run: the ten UI-scripting sections (1.1 not granted).
  - Two probe bugs found and fixed on the way:
    - the "new shell" matched the app's own `zsh -i -l -c …` environment query, so shells with `-c` no
      longer count;
    - a second launch on the same port drove the first instance, so `launch()` now quits earlier
      instances first.
- [ ] 4.3 On the Mac, against bundles built from the rsynced tree, run the probe through the override and
  record each result under this task:
  - the fixed build passes every section;
  - an unsealed bundle (`identity: null`) fails the signature section;
  - a bundle without the `afterPack` hook fails the `default_app.asar` and licence sections;
  - a launch with the SSH environment makes the minimal-environment control red;
  - the build without 3.1–3.3 fails the menu, `Cmd+Q`, and reopen sections.
  - Run remotely, 2026-10-08, against dmgs from `package-mac.mjs` with overrides:
    - unsealed (`-c.mac.identity=null`): the signature check is red ("code has no resources but signature
      indicates they must be present"), and the rest is unchanged;
    - without the hook (`-c.afterPack=<a no-op hook>`): "no placeholder application ships" and the
      licence check are red (missing `LICENSE.electron.txt`, `LICENSES.chromium.html`); the seal is
      still valid;
    - environment: with `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`, `command -v claude` prints a path, which turns the
      minimal-environment check red.
  - Still to run at the Mac: the fixed build's UI sections, and the build without 3.1–3.3.
- [x] 4.4 With the Electron cache emptied on the Mac and `ELECTRON_MIRROR` set, run the install and
  `package-mac` once. Record that the archive came from the mirror and passed the pinned checksum. This is
  the carrier of "A mirror delivers a verified archive".
  - 2026-10-08, on the Mac. `HOME` pointed at an empty directory, so `@electron/get`'s cache was empty;
    `electron_config_cache` is read by `electron`'s own install script, not by `@electron/get`. With
    `ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/`, the 123 MB archive came from the mirror in
    about 10 s, into the fresh cache. `[package-mac] … matches the pinned checksum`, and the build
    continued.
- [x] 4.5 `scripts/scenario-coverage.test.mjs`: register `macos-dmg-packaging` in `COVERED_CHANGES`.
  - **A scenario whose title already has a row** (about 30, including the MODIFIED copies): update that
    row's carrier, `greenIfAbsent`, `mutation`, and note. For example, the mutation that removes
    `build.extraFiles` becomes `build.linux.extraFiles`, and "Confirming closes the window…" becomes
    Linux-only.
  - **A new title** gets a new row.
  - Labels are found in the probes and tests, not from memory, and the dogfood gaps are marked as such.

  Verify: `npm test` green.

  - 86 rows for the change. The three level scenarios of `build-identity` already had rows and are
    unchanged.
  - Three carriers do not exist: the mirror run (a manual run, 4.4), the macOS limitations prose, and two
    status-bar scenarios that had no carrier before this change.
  - The Linux Alt-menu row is honest about being unit-level only.
  - New guard, `packaging-config.test.mjs`: the macOS install facts in both READMEs and both install
    pages, and the macOS build facts in both READMEs, with a control.
## 5. Documentation

- [ ] 5.1 Open GitHub issues for the macOS gaps this change documents but does not fix, so that the docs and
  spec gaps can link them:
  - a pty's working directory on macOS (shell restore and the status bar);
  - automatic hibernation of shells on macOS;
  - the monospace font list on macOS;
  - `npm run dev` data isolation on macOS;
  - `Ctrl+↑/↓` vs Mission Control;
  - `node_modules` drift on `dist:linux`;
  - building on CI.

  Close issue #63 (the macOS build) with a reference to this change once 6.3 has published the dmg.
- [x] 5.2 `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md`, kept in sync:
  - the platform status (Linux, and macOS on Apple Silicon);
  - the macOS install: minimum version, the first-launch allow step for 13 and for 15 or later, the
    damaged-app escape, why privacy prompts name spekterm, that updates may ask again, the data location,
    and the limitations with their issue links;
  - building for macOS: a release commit, `dist:mac`, `ELECTRON_MIRROR` (which applies to `npm ci` too),
    and the trial-build command marked as not a release.

  Verify: `packaging-config`'s README checks, and the "Nothing says" phrases searched over the READMEs.
  - Written by a delegated agent, 2026-10-08; reviewed here. `site-boundary.test.mjs` follows the plan's
    renamed `forbiddenPhrases` (it read `linuxOnlyPhrases`) and now normalises whitespace too.
- [x] 5.3 Website, both languages (`site/src/content/docs/` and `zh-tw/`), wherever it says something that
  is not true on macOS:
  - landing page: platform status, and a download button that names no single format;
  - documentation home: platform status, and the "Download the AppImage" card;
  - install: a macOS section;
  - first workspace;
  - terminals and sessions: closing the window, where shells restart, idle hibernation, the status bar's
    directory;
  - settings: the font list;
  - keyboard shortcuts: the `Ctrl+↑/↓` macOS note;
  - inbox and Slack, and data and network: the macOS data path, and that the app keeps running (and
    polling) with its window closed;
  - FAQ: the macOS answer;
  - troubleshooting: damaged app, prompts, permissions after update.

  `site/src/i18n/*.json` hero strings; `site/src/content-plan.json` and `site/scripts/check-content.mjs`
  get the new phrases and the forbidden ones from the `project-website` scenarios. Verify:
  `(cd site && npm ci && npm run build)` green, and the forbidden phrases searched over `site/dist` return
  nothing.
  - Pages changed in both languages:
    - landing (button "Download", platform status), docs home, install (a macOS section);
    - first workspace, terminals and sessions, settings, keyboard shortcuts;
    - inbox and Slack, data and network, FAQ, troubleshooting.
  - `check-content.mjs` bans the scenario phrases (case- and whitespace-insensitive) and a one-format
    download link, with self-test cases.
  - `(cd site && npm ci && npm run build)` passed. A search of `site/dist` and the READMEs for the banned
    phrases finds 0, against 2 on the committed READMEs.
  - Unverified: the Traditional Chinese macOS label for "Open Anyway" (written as 「強制打開」 with the
    English name beside it).
- [x] 5.4 `openspec/specs/desktop-packaging/spec.md` Purpose: it describes the Linux and macOS artifacts.
  Purpose is not carried by deltas, so it is edited directly.
- [x] 5.5 `docs/PRD.md`: §11 Phase 6 (macOS on Apple Silicon, ad-hoc, delivered; what remains: Developer ID,
  notarization, auto-update, Intel, Windows, CI build), and the other places that say macOS is not done
  (the status near the top, and the platform notes further down).
- [x] 5.6 `CLAUDE.md`:
  - the commands: `dist:mac` and `probe:package:mac`;
  - "現況": macOS is no longer "尚未開始";
  - the native menu paragraph: the macOS menu and its reason, replacing "macOS 未實測";
  - the measured macOS caveats (quit order, `open` passing the environment, `ps -E`, privacy prompt
    attribution), each in its section or in `docs/lessons/` with a trigger row.

  Verify: `public-hygiene` and `naming` tests green.

  - New `docs/lessons/macos.md`: 15 measured facts plus the open measurements, with a trigger row in
    CLAUDE.md.
## 6. Release and dogfood (each step leaving the machine waits for the maintainer — design Migration Plan)

- [ ] 6.1 After the maintainer has tried the rsynced build on the Mac: commit everything except `site/`,
  then run `dist:linux`. Ask before pushing to master.
- [ ] 6.2 On the Mac: `git pull`, `npm run dist:mac`, `npm run probe:package:mac`. Every section is green;
  "not run" is not acceptable for this run.
- [ ] 6.3 Ask before uploading the AppImage and the dmg to the GitHub release. Then commit the `site/`
  changes, and ask before pushing them (the push deploys the website).
- [ ] 6.4 Dogfood on the Mac, results recorded under this task:
  - download the released dmg in a browser; confirm the "unidentified developer" path and Open Anyway,
    with the unsealed build as the "damaged" control;
  - install the next release over this one, and note which permission prompts return;
  - with no window open, click a real notification; confirm that a window opens and shows the item.
