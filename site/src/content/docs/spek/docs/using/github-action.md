The [spek action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/spek-openspec-static-site) builds a single,
self-contained HTML page of your repository's OpenSpec — the same views as the other forms, with the
content embedded — in your own GitHub Actions. It can also write status badges.

## Basic use

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # full history, for the changes' dates

- uses: spekhq/spek@v1
  with:
    title: "My Project - OpenSpec"
```

Without the full git history the build still succeeds; the changes' dates are then unavailable.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

```yaml
name: Build OpenSpec Site
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ["openspec/**"]

permissions:
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: spekhq/spek@v1
        with:
          title: "My Project - OpenSpec"

      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v5
        with:
          path: spek-output

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deploy
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v5
```

## Inputs and outputs

| Input | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-path` | The directory that contains `openspec/` | `.` |
| `output-path` | Where to write the page | `spek-output/spek.html` |
| `title` | The page's title | `OpenSpec Viewer` |
| `spek-version` | Which spek source to build with: a tag, branch, or commit | `master` |
| `generate-badges` | Also write the status badges | `false` |

| Output | |
|---|---|
| `html-path` | The page's absolute path |
| `badges-path` | The badges directory's absolute path |

`spekhq/spek@v1` picks the action; `spek-version` picks the spek source it builds the page with, and that
defaults to spek's main branch. To build with a fixed release, set `spek-version` to one of the tags on
[spek's releases page](https://github.com/spekhq/spek/releases).

## Badges

With `generate-badges: true` the action also writes three SVG badges next to the page — the number of
specs, open changes, and task progress. They are drawn by the action itself; no badge service is called.
Deploy them with the page and reference them from your README:

```markdown
![Specs](https://your-user.github.io/your-repo/badges/specs.svg)
![Open Changes](https://your-user.github.io/your-repo/badges/open_changes.svg)
![Tasks](https://your-user.github.io/your-repo/badges/tasks.svg)
```

## What runs

The action runs in your workflow: it checks out spek's source at `spek-version`, installs spek's
dependencies and the OpenSpec CLI from npm, and builds the page with the CLI's usage statistics turned off.
See [Data and network](/spek/docs/reference/data-and-network/).
